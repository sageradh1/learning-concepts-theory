SSL = Secure Sockets Layer

SSL provides a secure link between a client (a browser or an email client) and a server (a website or a mail server). 
The SSL security protocol determines the variables of the encryption for the data and link. 
To keep your server data secure, you need to create a security certificate. 

There are two options:
1) Self-Signed Certificate
2) Signed Certificate from a Certified Authority(CA)

Security wise both ensure equal encryption between client and server. 
However, CA certificate ensures the ownership of the server . so people prefer to have CA certificate when the webapp
handle credit card information or other important data.

For website in development and that dont contain very important information, self-signed certificate can be used.


Had to stop docker container because it was already using port 80 and certbot was not being able to use it to generation of new certificate:
Now, as it has been generated we can backup (etc/letsencrypt)secret pem and key ... specially inside live folder

Dont forget to redirect http to https


A(http) or AAAA(https) records = yourbasket.com     = points to IP 32.121.123.123
Alias/CName                    = www.yourbasket.com = other name/variation of main domain / A records
                               = docs.google.com
                               = mail.google.com  
MX  = for mail server
PTR = for pointing
SOA = State of authority created when zones are declared they include NS
NS = nameserver
