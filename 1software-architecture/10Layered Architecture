Systems can be divided into separate layers such as :
    1. Presentation layer(highest)
    2. Bussiness layer (lower)
    3. Data layer (lowest)

Data are passed from lower layer to higher layer.
Benefit of layers:
    1. Separation of concern
    2. Loosy coupled system (one layer doesnt need to have knowledge about every other layers)

Disadvantage:
    1. Increase in overhead as communication will always happen through certain number of layers.

If communication is always happening between two layers without need of intermediate layers, then we must reconsider 
our design architecture and might change the architecture to other.
