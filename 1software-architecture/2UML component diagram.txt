Components are defined as independent, encapsulated units within a system.
What sets component diagrams apart from a lot of other diagrams is that they are about high-level structure and not about details like attributes and methods.

Interface refers to the way for communication between both.
Ball-socket connectors are used to show interface between the components. 
here, socket refers to "required" interface that shows it expects a certain interface provided by some other component to be able to achieve its responsibilities
ball refers to "provided" interface that matches the above mentioned "required" component.

Also third party libraries should be mentioned if any are used.
