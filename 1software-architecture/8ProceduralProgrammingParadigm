Procedural Programming Paradigm:

    Suitable for system where computation is focused. better for small systems and simple solutions.

    In this paradigm, Main program and subroutines are used to create systems.

    Modularity and reuse

    There is heirachy in execution. the diagram is called Call tree because main program branches out to subroutines.
    Subrountines further call other sub-routines.
