This diagram is used to show high level behaviour of the system how controls flow from one activity to another.
They dont care about the implementation.

Activity refers to certain action that the user can perform to change the flow of the game.

full ball (Complete circle)      = starting state
half ball (ring around a circle) = ending state
pill like diagram = intermediate activity

Sometimes two or more things happen concurrently or sometimes they end simultaneously. Suppose when user starts a level and sounds also starts.
These are two different task happening concurrently. Partitions are boxes or divisions used in this case. Starting the game in one partition will
initiate sound task in another partition.
